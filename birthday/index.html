        Oye…We don’t even have a single photo together, but in my heart I’ve imagined so many moments of us. That imaginary picture means more to me than anything real.
Since childhood, I have never been this open or this close with anyone. You are the only person I have truly trusted with my heart. Talking to you feels safe… 
I pray to God  that you stay happy, healthy, and peaceful. Your happiness genuinely matters to me more than you know.
I always want to make your birthday special every year, not just as a formality, but because you are truly special to me… more than I can ever explain.No matter where life takes Us,I will always sliently wish the best for you ❤️✨❤️</p>
    <p>Zero chance infinity Hope ❤️🧿♾️</p>
